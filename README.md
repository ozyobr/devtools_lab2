We'll have a super time. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. Let's have a happy little tree in here. Let's do that again. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk.

Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet.

See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. Put it in, leave it alone. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us.

A beautiful little sunset. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. Take your time. Speed will come later. All you have to learn here is how to have fun.

So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. We have a fantastic little sky! We'll make some happy little bushes here. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy.

Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington.

All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light.
